<center><h2>About Flomad</h2>
<div id="aboutflomad">
<p>
Flomad is a fun and exciting new way to interact with the people around you, both near and far. Flomad allows people to come together to create something brilliant in a collaborative way. <br /><br />

Flomad is a platform that allows for the collaborative creation of stories. People take turns adding lines to a story, and each input can be no greater than 120 characters. Eventually, these games will have points rewarded for your contribution to the story as well as specific goals. This will allow people to tell a story while playing a strategic game. Flomad is both fun and challenging. <br /><br />

The name comes from a combination of Flow and Nomad. Nomads were extraordinary survivors who traveled around the world, experiencing new things and adding new stories to their lives every step along the way. Like these Nomads, Flomad will allow you to share all of your stories and life experiences that have yet to be told. And hell, you might meet some new friends along the way. <br /><br />

Join the community. Flow with Flomad and create something new in a fun way.<br /><br />

Go ahead. Be Creative
